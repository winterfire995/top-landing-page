# top-landing-page

In this project, I will create a landing page for a website from start to finish using HTML and CSS coding. I will demonstrate my ability to effectively create, label and organize my HTML content as well as stylize it using various CSS properties. This project is part of The Odin Project's free course for HTML and CSS. 

I am attempting to match the design found here: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png

while using information regarding colors and fonts from here: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/02.png

I will also be working on how to effectively utilize commits and commit messages to track my progress through this project.
